### CV
I've decided to open my CV. This project is created as a one-file HTML page.

Why one file? CSS can be separated and JS too. While this is a valid argument, I've considered that most of the time, a CV has to be uploaded. And most of the time, it should be one file. No one will bother with ZIP. This project packs everything into one file.

Not possible to upload HTML? No problem, the html2pdf library comes into play. It enables you to generate PDFs from HTML.

Are you a coder and want to use this project? I mean, everyone who knows the basics can do this. If you are lazy as I am, you can edit this project.
