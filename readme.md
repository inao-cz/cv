### CV
I've decided to open my CV. This project is designed as one-file HTML page.

Why one file? CSS can be separated and JS too. While this is a valid argument, I've taken into a count that most of the time, CV has to be uploaded. And most of the time, it should be one-file. No one will bother with ZIP where you will find HTML, CSS and JS. This packs everything into one file.

Not possible to upload HTML? Not a problem, that's where html2pdf library comes into play. This enables you to generate PDF from HTML.

Are you a coder and want to use this project? I mean, everyone who knows basics can do this but if you are lazy as I am, you can edit this project. But please, keep in mind that this project is covered by License.
